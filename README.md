## About

This repository contains a series of mini-projects (e.g., `Mini-project1`, `Mini-project2`) that explore different aspects of DOM manipulation using plain JavaScript. Each project is self-contained and focuses on one or more core techniques like selecting elements, handling events, modifying the DOM, and creating interactivity.

## Features

- Element selection using:
  - `getElementById`
  - `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`
- Attribute and style manipulation
- Creating, appending, and removing elements dynamically
- Event handling and interactivity
- Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## Installation

To run any of the mini-projects locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reellz/JavaScript_DOM.git

cd JavaScript_DOM
````

Each folder (e.g., `Mini-project1/`) includes its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can open the HTML file directly in your browser or serve it using a local server.

## Usage

1. Navigate into a project folder, such as:

   ```bash
   cd Mini-project1
   ```

2. Open the HTML file in your browser:

   * Double-click `index.html`
   * Or use a local development server, e.g.:

     ```bash
     npx live-server
     ```

3. Interact with the page to see how the JavaScript manipulates the DOM.
